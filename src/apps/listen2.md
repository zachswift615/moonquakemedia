## Features

### See Every Word as It's Spoken

Unlike basic text-to-speech, Listen2 uses advanced audio alignment to highlight each word precisely as it's read. This isn't just a nice visual—it's a comprehension breakthrough for visual learners, people with dyslexia, and anyone who wants to actually remember what they hear.

- Word, sentence, or paragraph highlighting modes
- Real-time synchronization using CTC forced alignment
- Automatically adjusts to your device's capabilities
- Disable entirely if you prefer audio-only

---

### 40+ Voices. Zero Internet Required.

Listen2 uses Piper neural TTS—the same technology behind the best open-source voice assistants. Every voice is downloaded once and runs entirely on your device. No internet connection, no cloud processing, no privacy concerns.

- 40+ voices across multiple languages
- Male, female, and neutral voice options
- Preview any voice before downloading
- Quality options from lightweight to studio-grade

> Works on airplane mode. Works in the subway. Works everywhere.

---

### PDF. EPUB. Google Drive. Clipboard. Done.

Stop converting files or emailing documents to yourself. Listen2 imports directly from your Files app, Google Drive shared links, or just paste text from anywhere. Smart text processing handles hyphenation, headers, and messy PDF layouts.

**Supported formats:**
- PDF (with smart layout extraction)
- EPUB (with chapter detection)
- Plain text and Markdown
- Clipboard (paste anything)
- Google Drive shared links

---

- Control Center integration
- Siri: "Read my clipboard with Listen2"
