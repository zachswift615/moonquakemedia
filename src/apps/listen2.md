## Features In-Depth

### Word-Level Highlighting

**See Every Word as It's Spoken**

Unlike basic text-to-speech, Listen2 uses advanced audio alignment to highlight each word precisely as it's read. This isn't just a nice visual—it's a comprehension breakthrough for visual learners, people with dyslexia, and anyone who wants to actually remember what they hear.

- Word, sentence, or paragraph highlighting modes
- Real-time synchronization using CTC forced alignment
- Automatically adjusts to your device's capabilities
- Disable entirely if you prefer audio-only

> "The highlighting is why I finally finished my thesis reading list." — Early tester

### Natural Voices, Completely Offline

**20+ Voices. Zero Internet Required.**

Listen2 uses Piper neural TTS—the same technology behind the best open-source voice assistants. Every voice is downloaded once and runs entirely on your device. No internet connection, no cloud processing, no privacy concerns.

- 20+ voices (English US, UK, etc.)
- Male, female, and neutral voice options
- Preview any voice before downloading
- Quality options from lightweight to studio-grade

> Works on airplane mode. Works in the subway. Works everywhere.

### Multi-Format Import

**PDF. EPUB. Google Drive. Clipboard. Done.**

Stop converting files or emailing documents to yourself. Listen2 imports directly from your Files app, Google Drive shared links, or just paste text from anywhere. Smart text processing handles hyphenation, headers, and messy PDF layouts.

**Supported Formats:**
- PDF (with smart layout extraction)
- EPUB (with chapter detection)
- Plain text and Markdown
- Clipboard (paste anything)
- Google Drive shared links

> "I just paste my professor's lecture notes and listen on the way to class." — University student
