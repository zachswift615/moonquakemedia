## Introduction

Moonquake Media ("we", "our", or "us") operates the GigScroll mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

**We do not collect any personal data.**

GigScroll does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal information. The app works entirely offline and does not collect or transmit any data to our servers.

### Usage Data

**We do not collect usage data or analytics.**

The app does not track how you use it, which features you access, or any other usage patterns. Your creative workflow remains completely private.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data created in GigScroll is stored locally on your device using iOS Core Data:

- **Songs:** Titles, artists, lyrics, and formatting preferences
- **Setlists:** Your organized song collections
- **Settings:** Theme preferences, font choices, and app configurations

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it using the app's export features.

### iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your GigScroll data may be included in your device's automatic backups. This is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service and is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Third-Party Services

### Online Search Features (Optional)

When you use the optional online search features, the app makes requests to third-party APIs:

**Lyrics Search:** When searching for song lyrics, the app queries:

- **ChartLyrics API** ([www.chartlyrics.com](http://www.chartlyrics.com)) - Primary lyrics source
- **Lyrics.ovh API** ([lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io)) - Backup lyrics source when ChartLyrics is unavailable

**Song Autocomplete:** When typing in the search bar, the app queries:

- **iTunes Search API** ([Apple iTunes Search](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/)) - For song title and artist suggestions

**What's sent:** Only the song title and/or artist name you enter

**What's received:** Publicly available song data and lyrics

**No tracking:** These are public APIs that do not require authentication or track individual users

### Apple In-App Purchase

When you purchase the Pro unlock, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to any payment information. Your purchase is linked to your Apple ID and managed by Apple.

For information about how Apple handles your payment data, please see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Data Export and Sharing

GigScroll provides features to export your data:

- **Export songs/setlists:** You can export your songs and setlists as .gigscroll files (JSON format) to share with other devices or backup
- **Share functionality:** Uses iOS native share sheet to export files - you control where exported data goes

We do not receive or have access to any data you export. All export operations happen locally on your device.

## Children's Privacy

GigScroll is rated 13+ due to the ability to search for and view song lyrics that may contain mature content. While we do not collect any data from users of any age, parents should be aware that the app allows searching for lyrics from any publicly available song, which may include explicit or mature content.

Since we do not collect any data, there are no special considerations for children's privacy beyond the protections already described in this policy.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't collect any information, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures:

- Use a strong device passcode
- Enable Touch ID/Face ID
- Keep your iOS updated
- Regularly backup your device

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is accessible within the app
- **Delete:** Delete songs/setlists within the app, or uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Export:** Export your data anytime using the built-in export features
- **Control:** Your data never leaves your device without your explicit action

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by:

- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting an in-app notification (for significant changes)

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## California Privacy Rights

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents have the right to request information about sharing personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Our answer:** We don't collect any personal information, so there's nothing to share with third parties.

## GDPR Compliance (European Users)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

- **Data Controller:** N/A - we don't control any data
- **Legal Basis:** N/A - no data processing occurs
- **Data Transfers:** N/A - no data leaves your device
- **Your Rights:** Fully maintained since you have complete control of local data

## Conclusion
