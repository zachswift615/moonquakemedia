## Introduction

Moonquake Media ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Quietus application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Quietus is designed as a completely offline, privacy-first application that processes everything locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Quietus does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal information. The app works entirely offline and does not collect or transmit any data to our servers or any third party.

### Usage Data

**We do not collect usage data or analytics.**

The app does not track how you use it, which presets you create, how long you listen, or any other usage patterns. Your listening habits remain completely private.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data created in Quietus is stored locally on your device:

- **Presets:** Your sound configurations stored as JSON files in the app's Documents directory
- **Generated Images:** AI-generated preset artwork stored in the app's Application Support directory
- **Settings:** Master volume, journey auto-start preference, and composer mode toggle stored in UserDefaults

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it using the app's export features.

### iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your Quietus data may be included in your device's automatic backups. Generated images are excluded from iCloud backup to conserve your storage. Device backups are handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service and are subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Network Activity

**Quietus makes zero network requests.** The app functions entirely offline with no internet connection required. The only external URLs in the app are links to this privacy policy and a support page, which open in your device's web browser when tapped.

## Apple Image Playground

Quietus optionally uses Apple's Image Playground feature (available on iOS 18.1+ and macOS 15.1+) to generate decorative artwork for your presets. When you use this feature:

- **Privacy-preserving:** Preset names are abstracted using an on-device language model before being sent to Image Playground (e.g., "My Sleep Meditation" becomes something generic like "Peaceful Calm")
- **Apple's service:** Image generation is handled by Apple's Image Playground, subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
- **Local storage:** Generated images are stored locally on your device and excluded from iCloud backup
- **Optional:** This feature is entirely optional and the app works fully without it

## Preset Sharing

Users can export presets as `.quietuspreset` or `.quietuspack` files via the native iOS/macOS share sheet. This sharing is:

- **User-initiated only:** The app never uploads anything automatically
- **Local processing:** Export files are created locally on your device
- **Your control:** You choose where exported files go via the system share sheet

We do not receive or have access to any data you export.

## Third-Party Services

### Third-Party SDKs

**We do not use any third-party SDKs** for analytics, crash reporting, advertising, social login, payment processing, or any form of data collection.

The app uses only two open-source libraries, both for purely local computation:

- **swift-atomics** (Apple) — Lock-free threading primitives for real-time audio processing. No network access.
- **ZIPFoundation** — File compression for preset import/export. No network access.

### Apple App Store

When you make in-app purchases, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to any payment information. Purchases are linked to your Apple ID and managed by Apple.

For information about how Apple handles your payment data, please see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Children's Privacy

Quietus does not collect any data from users of any age. The app contains no objectionable content and is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect personal information, there are no special considerations for children's privacy beyond the protections already described in this policy.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't collect any information, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures:

- Use a strong device passcode
- Enable Face ID or Touch ID
- Keep your iOS/macOS updated
- Regularly backup your device

## Your Rights and Control

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is accessible within the app
- **Delete:** Delete presets within the app, or uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Export:** Export your presets at any time using the built-in sharing features
- **Control:** Your data never leaves your device without your explicit action

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information.

**Our status:** We don't collect any personal information, so there's nothing to disclose, delete, or opt out of. We do not sell personal information because we don't collect it.

## European Privacy Rights (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

- **Data Controller:** N/A — we don't control any personal data
- **Legal Basis:** N/A — no personal data processing occurs
- **Data Transfers:** N/A — no personal data leaves your device
- **Your Rights:** Fully maintained since you have complete control of your local data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by:

- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting an in-app notification (for significant changes)

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Conclusion

At Moonquake Media, we believe that your listening habits and creative sound designs are your business alone. Quietus is designed as a completely private, offline application. We don't collect your data, we don't track your usage, and we don't want to. Your presets, your journeys, and your soundscapes stay on your device, where they belong.
