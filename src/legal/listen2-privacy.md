## Introduction

Moonquake Media ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Listen2 mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Listen2 is designed as a privacy-first application that processes everything locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Listen2 does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal information. The app works entirely offline (except for voice downloads) and does not collect or transmit any personal data to our servers.

### Usage Data

**We do not collect usage data or analytics.**

The app does not track how you use it, which documents you read, what voices you download, or any other usage patterns. Your reading habits remain completely private.

### Document Content

**We never access your documents.**

All documents you import into Listen2 are stored locally on your device. We cannot see, access, or read any of your content. Text-to-speech processing happens entirely on your device.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data created or imported in Listen2 is stored locally on your device:

- **Documents:** PDFs, EPUBs, text files, and clipboard imports
- **Reading Progress:** Your position in each document
- **Voice Files:** Downloaded TTS voice models
- **Settings:** Preferences like highlighting level and reading speed

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

### iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your Listen2 data may be included in your device's automatic backups. This is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service and is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Network Usage

### Voice Downloads

The only network activity in Listen2 is downloading voice files. When you download a voice:

- **What's sent:** A request for the specific voice file (no personal information)
- **What's received:** The voice model file
- **Source:** Voices are downloaded from public Piper TTS voice repositories

Voice downloads do not require authentication and do not track individual users.

### No Other Network Activity

Listen2 does not:

- Send analytics or telemetry data
- Connect to advertising networks
- Sync data to cloud services
- Make any network requests during normal use

## Third-Party Services

### Piper TTS Voices

Listen2 uses Piper text-to-speech voices, which are open-source voice models. When downloading voices, your device connects to publicly available voice repositories. No personal information is transmitted during this process.

### Apple App Store

When you purchase Listen2, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to any payment information. Your purchase is linked to your Apple ID and managed by Apple.

For information about how Apple handles your payment data, please see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Data We Do NOT Collect

To be completely clear, Listen2 does NOT collect:

| Data Type | Collected? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Name, email, or contact info | No |
| Device identifiers | No |
| Location data | No |
| Usage analytics | No |
| Document content | No |
| Reading history | No |
| Crash reports | No |
| Advertising identifiers | No |

## Children's Privacy

Listen2 does not collect any data from users of any age. Since we do not collect personal information, there are no special considerations for children's privacy beyond the protections already described in this policy.

Parents should be aware that Listen2 can read any text content imported by the user, which may include content of any nature depending on what is imported.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't collect any information, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures:

- Use a strong device passcode
- Enable Face ID or Touch ID
- Keep your iOS updated
- Regularly backup your device

## Your Rights and Control

Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is accessible within the app
- **Delete:** Delete documents within the app, or uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Export:** You can export or share your documents at any time
- **Control:** Your data never leaves your device without your explicit action

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information.

**Our status:** We don't collect any personal information, so there's nothing to disclose, delete, or opt out of. We do not sell personal information because we don't collect it.

## European Privacy Rights (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

- **Data Controller:** N/A - we don't control any personal data
- **Legal Basis:** N/A - no personal data processing occurs
- **Data Transfers:** N/A - no personal data leaves your device
- **Your Rights:** Fully maintained since you have complete control of your local data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by:

- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting an in-app notification (for significant changes)

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Conclusion

At Moonquake Media, we believe that what you read is your business alone. Listen2 is designed as a completely private, offline-first application.
