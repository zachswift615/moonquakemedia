## 1. Getting Started

### Welcome to GigScroll!

GigScroll is a professional lyrics teleprompter designed specifically for live performers. Whether you're playing a coffee shop or a stadium, GigScroll keeps your lyrics front and center with smooth auto-scrolling, customizable fonts, and stage-ready themes.

### First Launch

When you first open GigScroll, you'll see a quick tutorial covering the basics. You can always view it again from **Settings → Show Tutorial Again**.

### The Main Interface

GigScroll has three main tabs at the bottom:

- **Songs** - Your complete library of songs with search
- **Setlists** - Organized song collections for performances
- **Settings** - Themes, fonts, and data management

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} First Time Tip</h4>
<p>Start by adding a few songs to your library! You can search online for lyrics or add them manually. We recommend starting with 5-10 of your most-performed songs.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="content-section" id="songs">

## 2. Managing Your Songs

### Adding Songs

There are two ways to add songs to your library:

#### Option 1: Search Online for Lyrics

1. Tap the <span class="button-label">+</span> button in the top-right corner
2. Start typing a song title or artist name
3. As you type, you'll see autocomplete suggestions from iTunes
4. Select a suggestion, and GigScroll will automatically search for lyrics from multiple sources
5. Review the lyrics and tap <span class="button-label">Save</span>

<div class="feature-box">
<h4>{% icon "music", "inline-icon" %} Smart Lyrics Search</h4>
<p>GigScroll uses three different lyrics sources to give you the best chance of finding your song:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iTunes Search</strong> - Provides autocomplete suggestions as you type</li>
<li><strong>Lyrics.ovh</strong> - Primary lyrics database (100 searches per day)</li>
<li><strong>ChartLyrics</strong> - Backup lyrics source (unlimited searches)</li>
</ul>
<p>If one source doesn't have the lyrics, GigScroll automatically tries the next one!</p>
</div>

#### Option 2: Add Manually

1. Tap the <span class="button-label">+</span> button
2. Enter the song title and artist (optional)
3. Paste or type the lyrics in the large text area
4. Tap <span class="button-label">Save</span>

### Editing Songs

To edit a song's lyrics, title, or settings:

1. Tap on any song in your library
2. Make your changes (all changes auto-save)
3. Tap the back button when done

### Searching Your Library

Use the search bar at the top of the Songs tab to quickly find songs by title or artist. The search filters as you type.

### Recent Songs

Your most recently performed songs appear at the top of the Songs tab for quick access.

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} Pro Tip: Formatting Lyrics</h4>
<p>For best readability during performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use blank lines to separate verses and choruses</li>
<li>Add labels like [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Bridge] in brackets</li>
<li>Keep lines reasonably short (under 80 characters)</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Deleting Songs

To delete a song, swipe left on it in the Songs list and tap <span class="button-label">Delete</span>.

<div class="warning-box">
<h4>{% icon "alert-triangle", "inline-icon" %} Important</h4>
<p>Deleting a song will remove it from all setlists. This action cannot be undone (unless you have a backup).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="content-section" id="setlists">

## 3. Building Setlists

### What is a Setlist?

A setlist is an ordered collection of songs for a specific performance or gig. Setlists make it easy to flow through your songs in order without searching during a performance.

### Creating a Setlist

1. Go to the **Setlists** tab
2. Tap the <span class="button-label">+</span> button
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Saturday Night at Joe's Bar", "Worship Set - Dec 10")
4. Tap <span class="button-label">Create</span>

### Adding Songs to a Setlist

1. Tap on a setlist to open it
2. Tap the <span class="button-label">+</span> button in the top-right
3. Select songs from your library
4. Tap <span class="button-label">Done</span>

### Reordering Songs

1. Open a setlist
2. Tap <span class="button-label">Edit</span> in the top-left
3. Drag songs using the handle (≡) on the right side
4. Tap <span class="button-label">Done</span> when finished

### Removing Songs from a Setlist

Swipe left on any song in the setlist and tap <span class="button-label">Delete</span>. This only removes the song from this setlist - it stays in your library.

### Deleting a Setlist

To delete an entire setlist, swipe left on it in the Setlists tab and tap <span class="button-label">Delete</span>. The songs remain in your library.

### Sharing a Setlist

Share a setlist with bandmates or other performers:

1. Open the setlist
2. Tap the <span class="button-label">Share</span> button (square with arrow)
3. Choose how to share: AirDrop, Messages, Email, Files, etc.

The recipient can open the file in GigScroll to import your setlist with all the songs!

<div class="feature-box">
<h4>{% icon "theater", "inline-icon" %} Use Cases for Setlists</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venue-Specific</strong> - "Joe's Coffee House", "The Blue Room Friday"</li>
<li><strong>Genre-Based</strong> - "Country Classics", "80s Rock", "Jazz Standards"</li>
<li><strong>Event-Based</strong> - "Wedding Ceremony", "Cocktail Hour", "Reception"</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal</strong> - "Christmas Songs", "Summer Party Hits"</li>
<li><strong>Band Practice</strong> - "New Material", "Need to Practice", "Audience Favorites"</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div class="content-section" id="performance">

## 4. Performance Mode

### Starting a Performance

There are two ways to enter performance mode:

#### Option 1: Single Song

### Performance Mode Controls

Once in performance mode, you'll see your lyrics in large text with controls at the bottom:

<div class="feature-box">
<h4>{% icon "gamepad-2", "inline-icon" %} Control Panel</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>◀ Previous</strong> - Go to previous song in setlist (setlist mode only)</li>
<li><strong>[-] Slower</strong> - Decrease scroll speed</li>
<li><strong>[▶/⏸] Play/Pause</strong> - Start or stop auto-scrolling</li>
<li><strong>[+] Faster</strong> - Increase scroll speed</li>
<li><strong>[{% icon "save", "inline-icon-sm" %}] Save</strong> - Save current scroll speed as default for this song</li>
<li><strong>Next ▶</strong> - Go to next song in setlist (setlist mode only)</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Auto-Scrolling

The lyrics automatically scroll from bottom to top at your chosen speed. The scrolling is smooth and optimized for stage visibility.

#### Adjusting Scroll Speed

- Tap **+** to make it scroll faster
- Tap **-** to make it scroll slower
- Tap the **{% icon "save", "inline-icon-sm" %}** button to save your preferred speed for this song

### Navigating During Performance

When playing a setlist, you can:

- Tap **Next ▶** to advance to the next song
- Tap **◀ Previous** to go back to the previous song
- The position indicator (e.g., "2/5") shows where you are in the setlist

### Manual Scrolling

You can also scroll manually by swiping up or down on the lyrics. Auto-scrolling will pause when you manually scroll.

### Exiting Performance Mode

Tap the **X** or **Done** button in the top corner to exit back to the song editor or setlist.

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} Performance Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test your scroll speed</strong> before the gig - every song is different!</li>
<li><strong>Use Stage theme</strong> in bright stage lights for maximum readability</li>
<li><strong>Position your iPad</strong> at a comfortable angle about 2-3 feet away</li>
<li><strong>Practice advancing songs</strong> so you can do it smoothly mid-performance</li>
<li><strong>Keep your screen clean</strong> - fingerprints reduce readability on stage</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
<h4>{% icon "alert-triangle", "inline-icon" %} Battery Management</h4>
<p>Performance mode keeps your screen awake to prevent interruptions. Make sure your iPad is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully charged before your gig</li>
<li>Plugged in if playing a long set (3+ hours)</li>
<li>Set to maximum brightness for outdoor/bright venues</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<li>All setlists (including song order)</li>
<li>Your settings (theme, default font, default font size)</li>

## 8. Tips & Tricks

### For Live Performance

- **Practice setlist navigation** - Get comfortable with the Next/Previous buttons before your gig
- **Test lighting conditions** - Try different themes at your venue during soundcheck
- **Position your iPad securely** - Use a music stand or iPad mount
- **Bring a charger** - Performance mode keeps the screen on continuously
- **Have a backup** - Print your setlist or have it on your phone as a fallback
- **Disable notifications** - Turn on Do Not Disturb before performing

### Building Your Library Efficiently

- **Start with your most-played songs** - These get the most benefit from auto-scrolling
- **Use online search first** - It's faster than typing lyrics manually
- **Add songs after practice** - Make it a habit to add new material right away
- **Create setlists by venue** - Saves time when booking repeat gigs
- **Share with your band** - Everyone can have the same library by importing setlists

### Organizing Your Content

- **Use consistent naming** - "Venue Name - Date" for gig-specific setlists
- **Add artist names** - Helps with searching and looks professional
- **Clean up old setlists** - Delete one-time gig setlists after they're done
- **Create master setlists** - "All Country", "All Rock", etc. for quick building

### Maximizing Readability

- **Bigger is better on stage** - Start with 44pt and adjust from there
- **Stage theme for bright lights** - White-on-black has maximum contrast
- **Dark theme for dim venues** - Reduces eye strain in clubs and bars
- **Keep your screen clean** - Smudges kill readability under stage lights
- **Experiment with fonts** - Georgia and Helvetica are very readable

### Speed Optimization

- **Ballads** - Usually need speed around 0.5-1.0x
- **Medium tempo** - Speed around 1.0-1.5x works well
- **Fast songs** - May need 1.5-2.5x or more
- **Spoken word/rap** - Often need higher speeds (2.0-3.0x)
- **Save speeds per song** - Use the {% icon "save", "inline-icon-sm" %} button after you find the perfect speed

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} Pro Musician Tip</h4>
<p>Create a "warmup" setlist with 2-3 throwaway songs to practice your scroll speed and theme choice before the real performance starts. Delete it after the gig!</p>
</div>

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Lyrics Not Found

**Problem:** Online search can't find lyrics for my song.

**Solutions:**

- Try searching with just the artist name (sometimes this helps)
- Check your spelling of the title and artist
- Try searching for an alternate version (live, acoustic, remix)
- Some songs simply aren't in the databases - add them manually
- Very new songs may not be indexed yet

### Import Not Working

**Problem:** I can't import a backup file.

**Solutions:**

- Make sure the file has `.gigscroll` or `.json` extension
- Verify the file isn't corrupted (re-export if needed)
- Check that you're on the latest version of GigScroll
- Free tier users: Check if importing would exceed the 10-song limit
- Try importing on WiFi instead of cellular (better for large files)

### Scrolling Too Fast/Slow

**Problem:** The auto-scroll isn't matching my song tempo.

**Solutions:**

- Use the + and - buttons to adjust in real-time
- Remember to tap the {% icon "save", "inline-icon-sm" %} button to save your preferred speed
- Each song can have a different scroll speed
- If it's jumping around, try pausing and resuming to reset

### Can't Read Text on Stage

**Problem:** I can't read the lyrics during performance.

**Solutions:**

- Switch to **Stage theme** (highest contrast)
- Increase font size to 52pt or higher
- Increase screen brightness to 100%
- Clean your iPad screen thoroughly
- Move your iPad closer (optimal: 2-3 feet away)
- Angle the screen away from direct stage lights to reduce glare

### App Crashes During Performance

**Problem:** GigScroll crashes or freezes on stage.

**Solutions:**

- Update to the latest version of GigScroll
- Restart your iPad before the gig
- Close other apps to free up memory
- Turn off Background App Refresh for other apps
- Make sure you have at least 1GB of free storage
- As a backup, export your setlist and keep it in Notes app

### Battery Draining Quickly

**Problem:** My iPad battery dies during long sets.

**Solutions:**

- Performance mode keeps the screen on - this is normal
- Bring a charger and plug in during breaks
- Use a battery pack if no outlet is available
- Reduce screen brightness if the venue is dark
- Close all background apps before performing
- Enable Low Power Mode (Settings → Battery)
