<div class="content-section" id="playback">

## 3. Playback Controls

### Basic Controls

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} Pro Tip</h4>
<p>Adjust the reading speed to match your comprehension. Many users find 1.2x to 1.5x comfortable for casual listening, while 1.0x works better for dense or technical content.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="content-section" id="highlighting">

## 4. Highlighting Options

### Visual Tracking

Listen2 highlights text as it reads, helping you follow along visually. You can customize how highlighting works:

#### Highlighting Levels

- **Word** - Each word is highlighted as it's spoken (default)
- **Sentence** - The current sentence is highlighted
- **Paragraph** - The current paragraph is highlighted
- **Off** - No visual highlighting (audio only)

<div class="feature-box">
<h4>{% icon "zap", "inline-icon" %} Automatic Optimization</h4>
<p>On older devices with less available memory, Listen2 automatically uses sentence-level highlighting instead of word-level. This ensures smooth performance while still providing visual tracking.</p>
</div>

### Choosing a Highlighting Level

To change highlighting:

1. Open Settings
2. Find "Highlighting Level"
3. Choose your preferred option

<div class="tip-box">
<h4>{% icon "lightbulb", "inline-icon" %} When to Use Each Level</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word</strong> - Best for language learning or following along closely</li>
<li><strong>Sentence</strong> - Good balance of tracking and readability</li>
<li><strong>Paragraph</strong> - Best for skimming or light reading</li>
<li><strong>Off</strong> - When listening without looking at the screen</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

## 7. Tips & Troubleshooting

### Getting the Best Experience

- **Download voices on WiFi** - Voice files can be large, so download them when connected to WiFi
- **Use headphones** - For the best audio quality, especially in noisy environments
- **Adjust speed gradually** - Start at 1.0x and slowly increase as you get comfortable
- **Use sentence highlighting** - If word highlighting feels too fast

### Common Issues

#### Voice sounds choppy or delayed

- Close other apps to free up memory
- Try switching to sentence-level highlighting
- Restart the app

#### Document won't import

- Make sure the file is a supported format
- Check that the file isn't corrupted
- Try copying the text and using clipboard import instead

#### Highlighting is out of sync
